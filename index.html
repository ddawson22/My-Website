  About Me 
  </h2>
<p> 

 I've been an educator in the child development field for six years. However, in 2021, I decided that it was no longer my passion. I've always loved creating and making new things, and I discovered that a career in the tech industry would allow me to combine my love of technology and creative passions. 
</p>

<p>To name a few hobbies I have... I enjoy:
   <ol>
     <ol>Baking</ol>
     <ol>Traveling to new places</ol>
     <ol>Hiking with my dog</ol>
      
  </ol> 
</p>
<p>
I'm so excited to get started with Thinkful and begin my journey towards becoming a software engineer!
