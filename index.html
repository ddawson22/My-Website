  <h2> About Me  </h2>

<p> I've been an educator in the child development field for six years. However, in 2021, I decided that it was no longer my passion. I've always loved creating and making new things, and I discovered that a career in the tech industry would allow me to combine my love of technology and creative passions. 
</p>

<p>To name a few hobbies... I enjoy:</p>
   
     <ol>Baking</ol>
     <ol>Traveling to new places</ol>
     <ol>Hiking with my dog</ol>
     <ol>Anything with a puzzle!</ol>
     <ol>Game nights</ol>
      
<p>I'm so excited to get started with Thinkful and begin my journey towards becoming a software engineer! </p>
